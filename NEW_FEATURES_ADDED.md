# New Features Added - Oura Ring & Google Sheets Integration

## What Was Just Built

I've successfully added two powerful new MCP servers to your Personal Assistant that make it significantly smarter and more proactive!

### 1. Oura Ring MCP Server (Port 4016)

**Purpose:** Pulls biometric data from your Oura Ring for intelligent workout and recovery recommendations.

**Tools Available:**
- `get_daily_readiness()` - Readiness score, HRV, body temperature, recovery contributors
- `get_sleep_data()` - Sleep quality, duration, stages (deep, REM, light), efficiency
- `get_activity_summary()` - Steps, calories burned, activity time breakdown
- `get_recovery_status()` - Combined readiness + sleep analysis with workout recommendation

**Smart Features:**
- **Readiness Interpretation:**
  - 85+: "Excellent - perfect for heavy lifting!"
  - 70-84: "Good - solid workout day"
  - 60-69: "Fair - moderate intensity recommended"
  - <60: "Low - rest day or light recovery"

- **Sleep Analysis:**
  - Tracks total sleep hours
  - Sleep quality score
  - Deep/REM/Light sleep breakdown
  - Sleep efficiency

- **Recovery Recommendations:**
  - Combines readiness + sleep data
  - Tells you if you're recovered enough for intense workouts
  - Adjusts daily expectations based on biometrics

### 2. Google Sheets MCP Server (Port 4017)

**Purpose:** Reads your workout log from Google Sheets to track progress and ensure you're hitting your 6 days/week goal.

**Tools Available:**
- `get_recent_workouts(count)` - Get last N workouts
- `get_last_workout()` - Most recent workout with days since
- `get_workout_frequency(days)` - Check if hitting 6 days/week goal
- `get_exercise_progress(exercise_name)` - Track progress on specific lift
- `get_workout_summary()` - Overall stats and weekly progress

**Smart Features:**
- **Workout Frequency Tracking:**
  - Counts workouts in last 7 days
  - Calculates workouts per week average
  - Tells you if on track for 6 days/week goal
  - Shows how many more workouts needed

- **Progress Monitoring:**
  - Last workout date and days since
  - This week's workout count
  - Tracks specific exercises over time
  - History of any exercise you log

- **Proactive Reminders:**
  - "Last workout was 2 days ago - time to hit the gym!"
  - "Only 4 workouts this week - need 2 more to hit your goal"

## How Your Morning Briefing Changes

**BEFORE:**
```
Good morning! 
- Priority task: Find green card sponsor
- Calendar: 3 meetings today
- Remember your why!
```

**AFTER (with biometric data):**
```
Good morning!
- Readiness: 87% (8hrs sleep, HRV excellent) ðŸ’ª
  Perfect day for heavy lifting - push hard!
- Last workout: Back/Biceps (2 days ago)
  Today: Chest/Triceps scheduled
- This week: 5/6 workouts âœ“
  One more to hit your goal!
- Priority task: Find green card sponsor (green card: 28 days)
- Calendar: 3 meetings today
- Remember: You're building the body and life Monica deserves!
```

## Setup Required

### For Oura Ring:

1. Get your Oura API token:
   - Go to: https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens
   - Click "Create A New Personal Access Token"
   - Name it "Personal Assistant"
   - Copy the token

2. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   OURA_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   MCP_OURA_RING_PORT=4016
   ```

### For Google Sheets:

1. Your Google Cloud project (from Calendar setup) needs Google Sheets API enabled

2. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4001/auth/google/callback
   WORKOUT_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id_from_url
   MCP_GOOGLE_SHEETS_PORT=4017
   ```

3. Share your workout Google Sheet with the service account

## What The AI Can Now Do

### Smart Workout Recommendations:
- **Low Readiness:** "Your readiness is 58% and you only got 5 hours of sleep. I'd recommend a rest day or very light work. Your body needs recovery."
- **High Readiness:** "Readiness at 92%! You're fully recovered - perfect day to go for PRs on your lifts!"

### Proactive Workout Tracking:
- "I see you haven't worked out in 3 days. With the green card interview coming up, staying consistent with your body transformation is important. Ready to hit the gym?"
- "Great work! That's 6 workouts this week - you're crushing your goal!"

### Recovery Monitoring:
- "Your HRV has been low for 3 days. Consider adding an extra rest day this week."
- "Sleep quality has been excellent lately - your consistency is paying off!"

### Pattern Recognition:
- "I notice when you sleep less than 6 hours, you often skip morning workouts. Want to focus on earlier bedtime this week?"
- "You've hit your 6 workout/week goal for 3 weeks straight - incredible consistency!"

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `mcp-servers/oura-ring/src/index.ts` - Oura Ring MCP server
- `mcp-servers/google-sheets/src/index.ts` - Google Sheets MCP server
- `mcp-servers/oura-ring/package.json` - Dependencies
- `mcp-servers/google-sheets/package.json` - Dependencies
- Both servers have TypeScript configs

### Modified Files:
- `package.json` - Added new servers to `dev:mcp` and `install:all` scripts
- `backend/src/services/mcp-client.ts` - Added server URLs for both new MCP servers
- `backend/src/services/system-prompt.ts` - Updated Claude's knowledge with new tools
- `TODO_SETUP.md` - Updated with new setup requirements

## Running The New Servers

When you run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll now see **8 MCP servers** starting:
1. Habit Tracker (4010)
2. Calendar (4011)
3. Notion (4012)
4. Quiz (4013)
5. Morning Routine (4014)
6. Activity Tracker (4015)
7. **Oura Ring (4016)** âœ¨ NEW
8. **Google Sheets (4017)** âœ¨ NEW

## Testing The Integration

Once set up, try these in chat:

**Oura Ring:**
- "What's my readiness score today?"
- "How did I sleep last night?"
- "Am I recovered enough for heavy lifting?"

**Google Sheets:**
- "When was my last workout?"
- "Am I hitting my 6 days/week goal?"
- "Show me my workout frequency this week"

## Benefits For Your Goals

### Body Transformation (60-day challenge):
- âœ… Automated workout tracking from Google Sheets
- âœ… Recovery monitoring from Oura Ring
- âœ… Smart recommendations (rest vs push)
- âœ… Proactive reminders to stay on track

### ADHD Management:
- âœ… Less manual tracking (biometrics are automatic)
- âœ… Data-driven recommendations (not guessing)
- âœ… Pattern recognition (sleep â†’ productivity)
- âœ… Reduced cognitive load

### Morning Routine:
- âœ… Know if you're ready for intense workout
- âœ… Adjust day's expectations based on sleep
- âœ… Optimize workout timing based on recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Get Oura API token** (5 minutes)
2. **Enable Google Sheets API** (already have Google Cloud project from Calendar)
3. **Update `backend/.env`** with tokens
4. **Run `npm run dev`** - both new servers will start
5. **Test in chat** - Ask about readiness and workouts!
